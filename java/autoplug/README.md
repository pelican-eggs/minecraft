# AutoPlug-Client

AutoPlug-Client is a standalone, executable Java program that has multiple execution modes: Server-Wrapper, CLI-Tool, Background-Service. Its main purpose is to automate updating of any sofware related to servers and simplify server maintenance in general. While all server types are compatible (including Steam game servers), the majority of its features cater specifically to Minecraft, which is renowned as the world's top-selling game and boasts an exceptionally extensive modding community.

## Server Ports

The Minecraft server requires a single port for access (default 25565) but plugins may require extra ports to be enabled for the server. AutoPlug-Client can communicate with websites as well but it shouldn't require any extra ports to be opened.

| Port  | default |
