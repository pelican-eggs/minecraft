# Ketting

Ketting is a Minecraft server software that combines the best of both Forge and Spigot. It allows you to run mods and plugins on the same server, (hopefully) without any issues.

## Server Ports

The minecraft server requires a single port for access (default 25565) but plugins may require extra ports to enabled for the server.

| Port  | default |
|-------|---------|
| Game  | 25565   |

## Notes
Providing a Minecraft version of ``latest`` or an empty value will default to 1.20.1 as this is the lowest version that Ketting supports.
There is no API to query to find the true latest supported version.
